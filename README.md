## Overview
This is a simple desktop application built with Python and Tkinter for tracking daily expenses. It allows users to add, edit, and organize transactions by date, with features like salary reminders and low balance alerts. The app is designed for personal finance management and includes a very simple UI for better usability.

<br>Inspired by my own 'How much I spend in 15 days as a newly employed minimum wage earner'. 💅💅🥹🥹
